I have develop React Native projects with the help of Expo CLI.
Expo is a toolchain that allows you to quickly get a React Native app up and running without having to use native code in Xcode or Android Studio.

Download the app source code and run the application
https://github.com/nithijaigithub/reactnative-eshopping.git

Run the following command to install the developed React Native application.
npm install

After that, run the following command to start developing the application.
npm start

Opening the app on your phone/tablet

To open the app:

1. On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Home" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
2. On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
3. Open in the web browser... Press "w" to open web
   You can open the project on multiple devices simultaneously.

In this eShopping application, I have used almost all the React Hooks concept and React Native features.
